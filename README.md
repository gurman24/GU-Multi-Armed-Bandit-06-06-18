## Multi-Armed Bandit ##

In this project, we will examine the classic reinforcement learning problem known as the Multi-Armed Bandit. It is also known as the K-armed bandit problem or the N-armed bandit problem [1, see footnotes in the end]. Here, we are looking to maximize our potential gains from a set of potential resources by choosing between each resource so as to maximize our expected gains. [the term I've heard the most here is "maximize our rewards" and that entails knowing how much rewards, if any, might be derived from a set of actions]
